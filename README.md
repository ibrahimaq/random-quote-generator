# Random Quote Generator

## What it is
On the press of a button a random quote is generated and the background colour changes!
You can also share any quote to Twitter.

## Purpose of project
This is one of the first JavaScript projects I did after learning the fundementals of the language.

## What I learnt
Apart from the language learning curve I think reading Twitter's API document was a challenge. I took me a while to follow the document in baby-steps.

## Things to improve on
- Adding more social media share buttons
- Fetching quotes by authors instead of just random
- Host the API locally where one could create tags for each quote so as to allow for category filtering
